            <li><strong>Tarri Poha:</strong> A popular breakfast dish made from flattened rice served with spicy curry.
            </li>
            <p>
                Tari Poha is a popular breakfast dish from Vidarbha, celebrated for its unique flavors and satisfying
                texture. This dish features flattened rice (poha) that is cooked with a spicy, tangy gravy known as
                "tari," which is made from onions, tomatoes, and a blend of spices. The result is a hearty meal that is
                both nutritious and delicious.</p>
            <p>
                The preparation begins with sautéing onions and tomatoes, along with spices such as turmeric, mustard
                seeds, and green chilies, creating a rich, aromatic base. The flattened rice is then added to this
                mixture, allowing it to absorb the flavors while retaining a soft yet slightly crunchy texture. Often
                garnished with fresh coriander, peanuts, and a squeeze of lemon, Tari Poha is typically served hot and
                makes for a perfect start to the day. Its delightful combination of flavors makes it a beloved choice

                Orange Barfi from Vidarbha is a unique and delicious sweet treat that showcases the region's famous
                Nagpur oranges. Known for their vibrant color and rich flavor, these oranges are used to create a
                refreshing twist on traditional barfi. The sweet is made by combining fresh orange juice with khoya
                (milk solids), sugar, and flavored with cardamom.</p>
            <p>

                diamonds and often garnished with chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios. Orange Barfi is not only a
                delightful dessert but also reflects the agricultural richness of Vidarbha, making it a favorite during
